## Why?
The objective of this tool is to help the students to understand more easily how descriptive geometry works and developing the 	shape recognition.

##What can i do with it?
DiedricoApp has support for points, lines and planes, in other words, in thery you can view en 3d any exercise of descriptive geometry.
With this tool you can experiment, view and learn while you are touching and creating!

##How does it work?
The app consist of a few main classes:
  *Camera2BasicFragment is the class for take a picture with the camera
  *PeviewMenuActivity is the menu activity
  *LineSegment is where we scan the interesting points and lines with BoofCV
  *OpenGlActivity is where we pass the data for representing in 3D with OpenGL
